# Search Strategy Builder

The Search Strategy Builder is a tool designed to teach you how to create a search string using Boolean logic. While it is not a database and is not designed to input a search, you should be able to cut and paste the results into most databases' search boxes. Forked from [University of Arizona Libraries](https://github.com/ualibraries/search-strategy-builder)
